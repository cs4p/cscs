# dig
dig is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the  name
server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use, and clar‐
ity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than dig.

Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file.  A
brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when the -h option is given. The BIND 9 implementation of dig allows mul‐
tiple lookups to be issued from the command line.

Unless it is told to query a specific name server, dig tries each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable  server  addresses
are found, dig sends the query to the local host.

When no command-line arguments or options are given, dig performs an NS query for "." (the root).

It  is  possible  to  set  per-user defaults for dig via ${HOME}/.digrc. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the com‐
mand-line arguments. The -r option disables this feature, for scripts that need predictable behavior.

The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top-level domain names. Either use the -t and -c options to specify the type and class,
use the -q to specify the domain name, or use "IN." and "CH." when looking up these top-level domains.

# Installation
## MacOS
    brew install tool
## Debian
    apt install dnsutils
## Script
    curl http://example.com/script.sh

# Examples

## Get all DNS records for a domain
    dig domain_name any

The any DNS query is a special meta query which is now deprecated. Since around 2019, most public DNS servers have stopped answering most DNS ANY queries usefully [1].

If ANY queries do not enumerate multiple records, the only option is to request each record type (e.g. A, CNAME, or MX) individually.

## Perform a reverse lookup on a domain to see what IP it should resolve to
    dig -x ipAddress

Usage:  dig [@global-server] [domain] [q-type] [q-class] {q-opt}
            {global-d-opt} host [@local-server] {local-d-opt}
            [ host [@local-server] {local-d-opt} [...]]
